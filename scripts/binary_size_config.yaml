# Binary Size Tracker Configuration
#
# This file defines which contracts to track for binary size regression.
# Each contract should be a simple smart contract that represents different
# complexity levels and common patterns.

# Optimization levels to test
optimization_levels: ["O0", "O1", "O2", "O3"]
ignore_warnings: ["O0", "O1"]

# Thresholds for reporting (percentages)
thresholds:
  warning: 5.0     # Warn if size changes by more than 5%
  significant: 10.0 # Mark as significant if size changes by more than 10%
