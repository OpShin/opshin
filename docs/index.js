"doc":"    opshin                > You are building what you want. Why not also build  how you want? This is an implementation of smart contracts for Cardano which are written in a strict subset of valid Python. The general philosophy of this project is to write a compiler that ensure the following: If the program compiles then: 1. it is a valid Python program 2. the output running it with python is the same as running it on-chain.  Why opshin? - 100% valid Python. Leverage the existing tool stack for Python, syntax highlighting, linting, debugging, unit-testing, [property-based testing](https: hypothesis.readthedocs.io/), [verification](https: github.com/marcoeilers/nagini) - Intuitive. Just like Python. - Flexible. Imperative, functional, the way you want it. - Efficient & Secure. Static type inference ensures strict typing and optimized code  Getting Started  OpShin Pioneer Program Check out the [opshin-pioneer-program]( https: github.com/OpShin/opshin-pioneer-program) for a host of educational example contracts, test cases and off-chain code.  Example repository Check out the [opshin-starter-kit]( https: github.com/OpShin/opshin-starter-kit) repository for a quick start in setting up a development environment and compiling some sample contracts yourself. You can replace the contracts in your local copy of the repository with code from the  examples section here to start exploring different contracts.  Developer Community and Questions This repository contains a discussions page. Feel free to open up a new discussion with questions regarding development using opshin and using certain features. Others may be able to help you and will also benefit from the previously shared questions. Check out the community [here](https: github.com/OpShin/opshin/discussions) You can also chat with other developers [in the welcoming discord community](https: discord.gg/umR3A2g4uw) of OpShin  Installation Install Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11. Then run   python3 -m pip install opshin    Writing a Smart Contract A short non-complete introduction in starting to write smart contracts follows. 1. Make sure you understand EUTxOs, Addresses, Validators etc on Cardano. [There is a wonderful crashcourse by @KtorZ](https: aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/eutxo). The contract will work on these concepts 2. Make sure you understand python. opshin works like python and uses python. There are tons of tutorials for python, choose what suits you best. 3. Make sure your contract is valid python and the types check out. Write simple contracts first and run them using  opshin eval to get a feeling for how they work. 4. Make sure your contract is valid opshin code. Run  opshin compile and look at the compiler erros for guidance along what works and doesn't work and why. 5. Dig into the [ examples ](https: github.com/OpShin/opshin/tree/main/examples) to understand common patterns. Check out the [ prelude ](https: opshin.opshin.dev/opshin/prelude.html) for understanding how the Script Context is structured and how complex datums are defined. 6. Check out the [sample repository](https: github.com/OpShin/opshin-starter-kit) to find a sample setup for developing your own contract. In summary, a smart contract in opshin is defined by the function  validator in your contract file. The function validates that a specific value can be spent, minted, burned, withdrawn etc, depending on where it is invoked/used as a credential. If the function fails (i.e. raises an error of any kind such as a  KeyError or  AssertionError ) the validation is denied, and the funds can not be spent, minted, burned etc. > There is a subtle difference here in comparison to most other Smart Contract languages. > In opshin a validator may return anything (in particular also  False ) - as long as it does not fail, the execution is considered valid. > This is more similar to how contracts in Solidity always pass, unless they run out of gas or hit an error. > So make sure to  assert what you want to ensure to hold for validation! A simple contract called the \"Gift Contract\" verifies that only specific wallets can withdraw money. They are authenticated by a signature. If you don't understand what a pubkeyhash is and how this validates anything, check out [this gentle introduction into Cardanos EUTxO](https: aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/eutxo). Also see the [tutorial by  pycardano ](https: pycardano.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/plutus.html) for explanations on what each of the parameters to the validator means and how to build transactions with the contract.   from opshin.prelude import  @dataclass() class WithdrawDatum(PlutusData): pubkeyhash: bytes def validator(datum: WithdrawDatum, redeemer: None, context: ScriptContext) -> None: sig_present = False for s in context.tx_info.signatories: if datum.pubkeyhash  s: sig_present = True assert sig_present, \"Required signature missing\"   All contracts written in opshin are 100% valid python. Minting policies expect only a redeemer and script context as argument. Check out the [Architecture guide](https: github.com/OpShin/opshin/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md minting-policy -spending-validator-double-function) for details on how to write double functioning contracts. The [ examples ](https: github.com/OpShin/opshin/blob/main/examples) folder contains more examples. Also check out the [opshin-pioneer-program]( https: github.com/OpShin/opshin-pioneer-program) and [opshin-starter-kit]( https: github.com/OpShin/opshin-starter-kit) repo.  Compiling Write your program in python. You may start with the content of  examples . Arguments to scripts are passed in as Plutus Data objects in JSON notation. You can run any of the following commands    Evaluate script in Python - this can be used to make sure there are no obvious errors opshin eval spending examples/smart_contracts/assert_sum.py \"{\\\"int\\\": 4}\" \"{\\\"int\\\": 38}\" 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  Compile script to 'uplc', the Cardano Smart Contract assembly opshin compile spending examples/smart_contracts/assert_sum.py   Furthermore, you can add a shebang to the first line of the python file to indicate that it represents an opshin smart contract. You can choose from the following options: - a general shebang:  !opshin , which represents  opshin eval any - or a more specific purpose:  !/usr/bin/env -S opshin eval minting By doing so, you can transform your python file to an executable:  chmod +x your_file.py and execute it with  ./your_file.py , which will run  opshin eval any ./your_file.py under the hood.  Deploying The deploy process generates all artifacts required for usage with common libraries like [pycardano](https: github.com/Python-Cardano/pycardano), [lucid](https: github.com/spacebudz/lucid) and the [cardano-cli](https: github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node).    Automatically generate all artifacts needed for using this contract opshin build spending examples/smart_contracts/assert_sum.py   See the [tutorial by  pycardano ](https: pycardano.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/plutus.html) for explanations how to build transactions with  opshin contracts.  The small print _Not every valid python program is a valid smart contract_. Not all language features of python will or can be supported. The reasons are mainly of practical nature (i.e. we can't infer types when functions like  eval are allowed). Specifically, only a pure subset of python is allowed. Further, only immutable objects may be generated. For your program to be accepted, make sure to only make use of language constructs supported by the compiler. You will be notified of which constructs are not supported when trying to compile. You can also make use of the built-in linting command and check it for example with the following command:   opshin lint spending examples/smart_contracts/assert_sum.py    Name > Eopsin (Korean: \uc5c5\uc2e0; Hanja: \u696d\u795e) is the goddess of the storage and wealth in Korean mythology and shamanism. > [ .] Eopsin was believed to be a pitch-black snake that had ears.  1 (https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eopsin) Since this project tries to merge Python (a large serpent) and Pluto/Plutus (Greek wealth gods), the name appears fitting. The name e_opsin is pronounced _op-shin_. e  Contributing  Architecture This program consists of a few independent components: 1. An aggressive static type inferencer 2. Rewriting tools to simplify complex python expressions 3.

The  NodeTransformer will walk the AST and use the return value of the visitor methods to replace or remove the old node. If the return value of the visitor method is  None , the node will be removed from its location, otherwise it is replaced with the return value. The return value may be the original node in which case no replacement takes place. Here is an example transformer that rewrites all occurrences of name lookups ( foo ) to  data['foo']  class RewriteName(NodeTransformer): def visit_Name(self, node): return Subscript( value=Name(id='data', ctx=Load( , slice=Index(value=Str(s=node.id , ctx=node.ctx ) Keep in mind that if the node you're operating on has child nodes you must either transform the child nodes yourself or call the :meth: generic_visit method for the node first. For nodes that were part of a collection of statements (that applies to all statement nodes), the visitor may also return a list of nodes rather than just a single node. Usually you use the transformer like this node = YourTransformer().visit(node)"

"doc":"A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls a visitor function for every node found. This function may return a value which is forwarded by the  visit method. This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor methods. Per default the visitor functions for the nodes are  'visit_' + class name of the node. So a  TryFinally node visit function would be  visit_TryFinally . This behavior can be changed by overriding the  visit method. If no visitor function exists for a node (return value  None ) the  generic_visit visitor is used instead. Don't use the  NodeVisitor if you want to apply changes to nodes during traversing. For this a special visitor exists ( NodeTransformer ) that allows modifications."

"doc":"A class whose instances are single test cases. By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named 'runTest'. If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method that the instance is to execute. Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively. If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework in order to be run. When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:  failureException: determines which exception will be raised when the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.  longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in  addition to any explicit message passed.  maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required. Create an instance of the class that will use the named test method when executed. Raises a ValueError if the instance does not have a method with the specified name."

The  NodeTransformer will walk the AST and use the return value of the visitor methods to replace or remove the old node. If the return value of the visitor method is  None , the node will be removed from its location, otherwise it is replaced with the return value. The return value may be the original node in which case no replacement takes place. Here is an example transformer that rewrites all occurrences of name lookups ( foo ) to  data['foo']  class RewriteName(NodeTransformer): def visit_Name(self, node): return Subscript( value=Name(id='data', ctx=Load( , slice=Index(value=Str(s=node.id , ctx=node.ctx ) Keep in mind that if the node you're operating on has child nodes you must either transform the child nodes yourself or call the :meth: generic_visit method for the node first. For nodes that were part of a collection of statements (that applies to all statement nodes), the visitor may also return a list of nodes rather than just a single node. Usually you use the transformer like this node = YourTransformer().visit(node)"
